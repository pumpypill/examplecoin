## About the Project

"examplesite.fun" is a humorously nihilistic memecoin website that satirizes the copy-paste nature of typical cryptocurrency projects. The site openly admits to being unoriginal while maintaining professional aesthetics.

- Satirical team bios and company descriptions
- Honest disclaimers about the project's nature

### Interactive Elements

- Team member profiles reveal "secrets"
- Fake statistics that randomly appear
- Mock whitepaper with honest content
- Konami code easter egg

### Professional Appearance
- Modern gradient design
- Responsive layout
- Smooth animations
- Professional-looking tokenomics chart
- Timeline roadmap

## Running the Website

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser
2. No server required - it's a static website
3. All interactions work in modern browsers

## Browser Compatibility

- Chrome/Chromium (recommended)
- Firefox
- Safari
- Edge

## Technical Notes

The website uses vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with no external dependencies. The chart is drawn using HTML5 Canvas, and all animations use CSS transitions and keyframes.

## Easter Eggs

- Random floating statistics
- Hidden tooltips on various elements
